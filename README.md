# MathHack
CLI Swiss-Knife Math Tool for Middle to High School Students.

Written in C as well as Python.

As of v3 , MathHack Performs :

1) Regular calculation ( + - * / ^ and % (Modulo Division) , | (Root of LHS w.r.t RHS)) [**CAL**]

2) Factorisation - Outputs all factors of entered whole number [**FACT**]

3) Average - Calculates average of list of entered Integers (max 99) [**AVG**]

4) Checking if entered whole number is prime [**PRIME**]

5) Outputting all unique prime factors of entered whole numbers [**PMFACT**]

6) Generating multiplication tables from x * 2 to x * 19 for any whole number [**TAB**]

7) Calculates factorial of  whole number [**FCTRL**]

8) Calculates roots and discriminant of quadratic equation [**EQ**]

9) Outputs HCF/GCD of two whole numbers [**HCF**]

10) Simplifies a ration/fraction [**SMP**]

11) Trigonometric calculator for any trig. func. and rad/deg [**TCAL**]

12) Generates trigonometric table for entered rad/deg value [**TTAB**]

With all input takes as CLI arguments , for example : `./MathHack-v3 cal 4x2` returns `Result =  12.000000` in the terminal.
